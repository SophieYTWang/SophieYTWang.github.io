  A Correlation-Based Study of Gun Violence from an Economic Perspective (Feb 2022)
---

In February 2022, I co-authored an academic research project titled **"Correlation Analysis of Gun Violence in the United States from Economic Perspective"**, conducted in collaboration with fellow researchers from Beijing Technology and Business University and the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. This project explored how various **economic indicators** correlate with different forms of **gun violence**, using publicly available data from 2006 to 2020.

## Overview

While most studies focus on access to firearms or mental health, this project focused on underexplored macroeconomic variables such as the **Gini coefficient**, **poverty rate**, **labor participation**, and **homelessness**. We aimed to answer: *To what extent do regional economic conditions contribute to firearm-related deaths and mass shootings in the United States?*

## Methodology

- Data from 10 distinct datasets (sourced from **Statista**) were aggregated and standardized.
- Features included: gun death rates, homicide rates, population density, unemployment, household median income, and gun ownership.
- **Pearson correlation analysis** was used to test linear relationships between economic indicators and gun violence metrics.
- Data were analyzed across both **states** and **years**.

## Key Findings

- **Firearm death rate** is positively correlated with **gun ownership** and **negatively correlated with population density**.
- **Mass shooting events** are significantly correlated with **economic instability**, especially:
  - **Negatively** correlated with **labor participation** and **homelessness**
  - **Positively** correlated with **Gini coefficient** (income inequality)
- **Homicide by firearm** shows a **positive correlation** with **poverty rate** and **unemployment**.

These findings suggest that **uncoordinated and unstable economic development contributes to a higher likelihood of gun violence**, reinforcing the need for policy responses beyond traditional firearm regulation.
