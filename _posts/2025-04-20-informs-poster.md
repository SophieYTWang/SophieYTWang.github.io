  ## INFORMS 2025 Poster Presentation
  Data-driven procurement insights presented at the premier analytics conference
---


In **April 2025**, I had the honor of presenting my poster at the **INFORMS Annual Meeting**, one of the worldâ€™s leading conferences in analytics and operations research. My poster focused on **data-driven procurement optimization**, drawing from real-world consulting experience with a Fortune 100 client.

## Project Background

This research stemmed from my analytics consulting work with **PepsiCo**, supported by Kearney. We worked to streamline the companyâ€™s global sourcing process by analyzing procurement data covering **$1.7B in spend** across over **10,000 suppliers**.

I led data cleaning, visualization, and supplier benchmarking efforts, ultimately producing insights that could reduce the supplier base by over 50% and highlight over **$40M in cost-saving opportunities**.

## Poster Content

At INFORMS, I presented:

- A summary of the procurement challenge and fragmented data structure
- My data cleaning methodology for 210,000+ rows of historical supplier transactions
- KPI design for price variance, supplier duplication, and category compliance
- Visual dashboards (built in Tableau) to track cost ratios and estimated savings
- A supplier segmentation model highlighting low-performing vendors

## Key Takeaways

- Many suppliers deliver the same materials at significantly different unit prices due to lack of visibility.
- Consolidating long-tail suppliers and enforcing contract compliance can dramatically improve efficiency.
- Procurement dashboards, if well-designed, can become not just reporting tools, but decision-making catalysts.

## Conference Experience

Participating in INFORMS exposed me to a wide range of analytics applicationsâ€”from healthcare optimization to AI ethics. As a student poster presenter, I had the opportunity to receive feedback from industry leaders, professors, and fellow data scientists. It was both inspiring and affirming to see the real-world relevance of procurement analytics.
