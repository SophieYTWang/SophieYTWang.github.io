This project was completed in **October 2024** as part of a data visualization course, where our team explored **Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) mortality trends** among adults aged 35 and older across the United States. The analysis focused on identifying patterns in CHD mortality rates and examining how socioeconomic and environmental factors contribute to regional and demographic disparities.

## Objective

CHD remains the leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite medical advances, disparities persist across regions, income groups, and age brackets. Our goal was to use publicly available data to:

- Identify high-risk geographic regions and demographic groups
- Visualize long-term mortality trends and regional patterns
- Highlight the role of external risk factors such as income, education, air pollution, and obesity

## Methodology & Tools

We used **Tableau** to build dashboards that integrated and visualized data from:

- CDC Coronary Heart Disease Mortality Data (1999â€“2018)
- NHANES: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
- U.S. Census population estimates
- National Obesity by State Dataset (2015)
- PM2.5 County-level Air Quality Data (2018)

Visualizations included:  
- **Line charts** showing CHD and all-cause mortality trends over time  
- **Thematic maps** of mortality rate by state and county  
- **Bubble charts** comparing CHD rates across income, education, and age  
- **Scatter plots** analyzing correlations between PM2.5/obesity and CHD mortality

## Key Insights

- CHD mortality is strongly age-related: adults aged 65+ show nearly 3Ã— higher rates than those 35â€“64.
- Higher **poverty** and **lower educational attainment** are associated with increased CHD prevalence.
- **Air pollution (PM2.5)** and **obesity** are both positively correlated with CHD mortality, suggesting environmental and lifestyle impacts.
- Some high-rate regions, including parts of Texas and the East Coast, could benefit from more targeted public health interventions.

## Limitations

- Some datasets, such as obesity and PM2.5, cover only single years and do not reflect longitudinal trends.
- Correlations do not imply causation; further analysis is required to isolate specific contributing factors.
