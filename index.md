## What I Do

I specialize in transforming complex data into insights that drive business impact. Below are the core areas of my work, along with examples drawn from real-world projects:

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
  I prepare raw and inconsistent data for analysis through standardization, deduplication, and enrichment.  
  *Example:* Cleaned and standardized over 210,000 rows of procurement data from a global procurement platform, improving data accuracy by 20%.

- **Dashboard Design & Visualization**  
  I design clear, interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to help stakeholders monitor key metrics and make decisions.  
  *Example:* Built 4 Tableau dashboards to track unit prices, supplier lead times, and contract compliance, reducing supplier selection time.

- **Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning**  
  I apply machine learning techniques to generate forecasts and detect patterns in large datasets.  
  *Example:* Led a Kaggle NCAA project where I built ensemble models (XGBoost, logistic regression) to predict tournament outcomes using 50,000+ fan brackets.

- **Business Problem Solving & Analytical Thinking**  
  I approach each analysis with business context in mind, ensuring data is used to solve actual operational challenges.  
  *Example:* Identified supplier consolidation opportunities across 5,000+ vendors, contributing to a $40M cost-saving projection.

- **Cross-functional Collaboration & Communication**  
  I communicate technical findings clearly and effectively across business, consulting, and engineering teams.  
  *Example:* Worked with Kearney consultants and client stakeholders to validate KPIs and deliver procurement optimization insights that informed executive decisions.

## More About Me

I believe great data work isn't just about code — it's about curiosity, empathy, and communication. Here are a few things that define me beyond the spreadsheet:

- **I love turning complex into clear.**  
  Whether it’s translating data jargon into executive language or simplifying messy procurement records, I enjoy helping others *understand* what matters.

- **I believe dashboards should spark joy.**  
  My goal isn’t just functional visuals — it’s visualizations that make people say “oh, that makes sense.” Form follows function, always.

- **I’m driven by questions, not just answers.**  
  I’m most engaged when I get to ask “why?”, dig deeper, and see the bigger picture. That’s what makes data meaningful — the *story*, not just the stats.

- **I appreciate beauty in structure — whether in data or design.**  
  Clean code, well-labeled tables, and elegant notebooks make me smile. A good dashboard is like good architecture: intentional, efficient, and easy to navigate.

- **Outside of work, I find joy in simple things.**  
  I love swimming — it clears my head and sharpens my focus. Traveling gives me new perspectives, both in life and in problem-solving. And when I need emotional inspiration, I rewatch *La La Land*. What I love about *La La Land* isn’t just the music or colors — it’s the tension between dreams and reality, love and ambition. The film reminds me that life is often about choosing between two beautiful things, and that courage sometimes means walking away from one to honor the other. That balance — between heart and logic — is something I carry into both my personal life and my work.

- **I balance logic with life.**  
  I believe data science is as much about intuition as it is about structure. Lakeside walks help me reflect. Long swims help me reset. And stories — whether in data or in cinema — are what connect everything for me.
