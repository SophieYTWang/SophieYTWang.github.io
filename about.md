I believe great data work isn't just about code — it's about curiosity, empathy, and communication. Here are a few things that define me beyond the spreadsheet:

- **I love turning complex into clear.**  
  Whether it’s translating data jargon into executive language or simplifying messy procurement records, I enjoy helping others *understand* what matters.

- **I believe dashboards should spark joy.**  
  My goal isn’t just functional visuals — it’s visualizations that make people say “oh, that makes sense.” Form follows function, always.

- **I’m driven by questions, not just answers.**  
  I’m most engaged when I get to ask “why?”, dig deeper, and see the bigger picture. That’s what makes data meaningful — the *story*, not just the stats.

- **I appreciate beauty in structure — whether in data or design.**  
  Clean code, well-labeled tables, and elegant notebooks make me smile. A good dashboard is like good architecture: intentional, efficient, and easy to navigate.

- **Outside of work, I find joy in simple things.**  
  I love swimming — it clears my head and sharpens my focus. Traveling gives me new perspectives, both in life and in problem-solving. And when I need emotional inspiration, I rewatch *La La Land*. What I love about *La La Land* isn’t just the music or colors — it’s the tension between dreams and reality, love and ambition. The film reminds me that life is often about choosing between two beautiful things, and that courage sometimes means walking away from one to honor the other. That balance — between heart and logic — is something I carry into both my personal life and my work.

- **I balance logic with life.**  
  I believe data science is as much about intuition as it is about structure. Lakeside walks help me reflect. Long swims help me reset. And stories — whether in data or in cinema — are what connect everything for me.
