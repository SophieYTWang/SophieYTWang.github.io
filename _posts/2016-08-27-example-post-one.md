In February 2022, I had the privilege of participating in a research project under the guidance of **Dr. Noah Gift**, a renowned data scientist and professor at Duke University. This project focused on applying data science and machine learning techniques to literary analysis, specifically the works of **Ernest Hemingway**.

### Project Overview

The research objective was to explore Hemingway’s writing style and emotional tone using **natural language processing (NLP)** and **unsupervised learning**. The project was conducted in two phases:

1. **Sentiment & Syntax Analysis with AWS Comprehend**
   - Extracted texts from six major Hemingway novels.
   - Utilized Amazon AWS’s NLP platform to evaluate emotional tendencies across chapters.
   - Analyzed parts-of-speech distributions (e.g., verbs, nouns, adjectives) to assess Hemingway’s linguistic structure.

2. **Cluster Analysis & 3D Visualization**
   - Applied unsupervised learning to group and visualize stylistic similarities among novels.
   - Developed 2D and 3D cluster plots to reveal overlap in writing patterns.
   - Identified *The Old Man and the Sea* and *Across the River and into the Trees* as stylistically distinct compared to Hemingway’s other works.

### Key Findings

- Hemingway’s overall emotional tone is neutral to negative, consistent with his background as part of the “Lost Generation.”
- His writing style favors clarity and precision, characterized by high noun/verb usage and minimal modifiers.
- Despite different themes, Hemingway's major works demonstrate high structural similarity in syntax, with notable exceptions.

This project not only deepened my understanding of unsupervised learning and NLP tools but also taught me how data science can be applied in interdisciplinary contexts, bridging literature and machine analysis.
