## What I Do

I specialize in transforming complex data into insights that drive business impact. Below are the core areas of my work, along with examples drawn from real-world projects:

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
  I prepare raw and inconsistent data for analysis through standardization, deduplication, and enrichment.  
  *Example:* Cleaned and standardized over 210,000 rows of procurement data from a global procurement platform, improving data accuracy by 20%.

- **Dashboard Design & Visualization**  
  I design clear, interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to help stakeholders monitor key metrics and make decisions.  
  *Example:* Built 4 Tableau dashboards to track unit prices, supplier lead times, and contract compliance, reducing supplier selection time.

- **Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning**  
  I apply machine learning techniques to generate forecasts and detect patterns in large datasets.  
  *Example:* Led a Kaggle NCAA project where I built ensemble models (XGBoost, logistic regression) to predict tournament outcomes using 50,000+ fan brackets.

- **Business Problem Solving & Analytical Thinking**  
  I approach each analysis with business context in mind, ensuring data is used to solve actual operational challenges.  
  *Example:* Identified supplier consolidation opportunities across 5,000+ vendors, contributing to a $40M cost-saving projection.

- **Cross-functional Collaboration & Communication**  
  I communicate technical findings clearly and effectively across business, consulting, and engineering teams.  
  *Example:* Worked with Kearney consultants and client stakeholders to validate KPIs and deliver procurement optimization insights that informed executive decisions.
